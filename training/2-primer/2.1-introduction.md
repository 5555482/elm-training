# Elm Language Primer

In Elm there are only two top level things: Immutable Data and Pure Functions. During this prime are going to look at *data* types and pure functions.

## Pure Functions?!

A pure function is a functional programming term for a function that does not mutate the world out side of it.

Pure function:

```
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

Not pure function

```
let n = 1;

function add(x) {
  n = n + x;
  return n;
}
```

A pure function is basically a black box where the rest of the program cannot be effected by it. Furthermore, a pure function will always give you the same output for the same input. For example:

```
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

I can reason and know that no matter what if I call `add(1, 2)` I will *always* get back 3. However:

```
function add(x) {
  n = n + x
  return n;
}
```

I cannot reason and know that no what if I call `add(2)` I will get back 3. I mean I cannot even reason that I will get back a number at all. As a developer I would have to go track down `n` and figure out at point time does it equal what and if there is logic controlling it I will have track down the logic... you get the point.

Pure functions are easier to reason about, test, and provide a more reliable system. Do not get too hung up on vocab right now though. Elm only lets you do pure things any ways so you could never know what a pure function is and write great Elm code!
