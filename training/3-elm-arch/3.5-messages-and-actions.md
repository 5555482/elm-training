# Actions - User Interactions

In this section we are going to explore various parts of building our our view to handle the messages the user wants to send our future `update` function. This is kinda a bridge view the view part of our application and the update part of our application.


## Inputs and Buttons

Lets start off with updating our view function to contain HTML elements are user can perform actions on.


Here is our current view:

```
view : Model -> Html msg
view model =
  div
    []
    ([ h1
        []
        [ text "Todo List" ] ]
        ++ (List.map renderTodo model.todos))
```

Lets make a helper function to render our input and buttons for the user:

```
renderUserInputArea : Model -> Html msg
renderUserInputArea model =
  div
    []
    [ input [] []
    , button [] [ text "Add Todo!" ]
    ]
```


and update the view to look like:

```
view : Model -> Html msg
view model =
  div
    []
    ([ h1
        []
        [ text "Todo List" ]
      , renderUserInputArea model
      ]
        ++ (List.map renderTodo model.todos))
```

Are are passing in the model because we are going to need it to track the value of the user input.


## Type Msg

In Elm Archtecture we label our action by speficing a custom type for each action or message that can take place in our application with the `type` keyword. By convention this type is called `Msg`. Lets define that now, I normally define it right below the type alias for the model when working in a single file, but here is the defination.


```
type Msg
  = OnUserInput String
  | OnAddToDo
```

Full code:

```
import Html exposing (..)

main =
  view init

type alias Model =
  { todos : List String
  }

type Msg
  = OnUserInput String
  | OnAddToDo

init : Model
init =
  { todos = [ "Add some todos" ]
  }

view : Model -> Html msg
view model =
  div
    []
    ([ h1
        []
        [ text "Todo List" ]
      , renderUserInputArea model
      ]
        ++ (List.map renderTodo model.todos))



renderTodo : String -> Html msg
renderTodo todo =
  p
    []
    [ text todo ]


renderUserInputArea : Model -> Html msg
renderUserInputArea model =
  div
    []
    [ input [] []
    , button [] [ text "Add Todo!" ]
    ]
```

For the data constructor `OnUserInput` we are going to pass this to the `inInput` fuction which will pass `String` to our data constructor for us, namely the `String` is going to be the value of the input box. Speaking of `onInput` lets get that in our code. We will have to import another package for and this time we are only to exposing the functions we are going to need for two reasons: We only need two function out of a bunch, and to see the syntax of exposing funcitons by name from other modules.

Below your `Html` import (which order really does not matter):

```
import Html.Events exposing (onInput, onClick)

```

Here we are going going to expose the `onInput` and `onClick` functions to our file to work this from the `Html.Events` package. Now that we have these functions to work with lets have our `renderUserInputArea` function handle them:

```
renderUserInputArea : Model -> Html msg
renderUserInputArea model =
  div
    []
    [ input
        [ onInput OnUserInput
        ]
        []
    , button
        [ onClick OnAddToDo
        ]
        [ text "Add Todo!" ]
    ]
```


However, if you try to compile this code you will get:

```
-- TYPE MISMATCH ---------------------------------------------------------------

The type annotation for `renderUserInputArea` does not match its definition.

42| renderUserInputArea : Model -> Html msg
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The type annotation is saying:

    Model -> Html a

But I am inferring that the definition has this type:

    Model -> Html Msg

Hint: A type annotation is too generic. You can probably just switch to the type
I inferred. These issues can be subtle though, so read more about it.
<https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/blob/0.17.0/hints/type-annotations.md>
```
The reason why is because inside our Html we are using a concrete type for messages: `Msg`. The compile knows we are passing around `Html` with some type of some something, but `Html` with a `Msg`. So, the compiler is saying hey update your type signature to have the `Msg` type constructor. This will go for the `view` function too since it is returning with the return values that come from `renderUserInputArea`. So, we need to type `view`'s type signature as well.


Oddly, enought `renderTodo` does not have to have `Html Msg` as a return type because we are not passing around `Msg` yet inside in of that function yet, but we will. So go head and update that type signature as well.

Full Code

```
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Events exposing (onInput, onClick)


main =
  view init

type alias Model =
  { todos : List String
  }

type Msg
  = OnUserInput String
  | OnAddToDo

init : Model
init =
  { todos = [ "Add some todos" ]
  }

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div
    []
    ([ h1
        []
        [ text "Todo List" ]
      , renderUserInputArea model
      ]
        ++ (List.map renderTodo model.todos))



renderTodo : String -> Html Msg
renderTodo todo =
  p
    []
    [ text todo ]


renderUserInputArea : Model -> Html Msg
renderUserInputArea model =
  div
    []
    [ input
        [ onInput OnUserInput
        ]
        []
    , button
        [ onClick OnAddToDo
        ]
        [ text "Add Todo!" ]
    ]
```

Now we need a way to handle message being sent to our application, that is the `update` function, which is next!
