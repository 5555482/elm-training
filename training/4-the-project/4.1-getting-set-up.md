# Getting ready for fun(ctional) Programming

To get you started, so we do not have to worry about all the little details I have made a git repo called elm-simple-seed. This repo has away to build and watch your Elm code and to have a local server. It uses brunch which is a much simpler and faster webpack/grunt/gulp. I love it!

Go to where you want to clone the repo to get started and clone it with this line:

```
git clone git@github.com:mattludwigs/elm-simple-seed.git employee-directory
```

To get things set up:

```
cd employee-directory
npm install
elm-package install
```

This is our first dealings with `elm-package`. It came with your installation of `elm-platform`. It is the package manager for Elm. Again elm is very explicit even down to the naming of its tools.
