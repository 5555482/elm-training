# Learning Elm - Rough Rough Rough Draft (WIP)

There are some tutorials and guides to getting started with Elm. I developed this for a team traing in which I lead, and I am providing them as a source for others to use if they dare. However, sometimes the guides are a little generalized in a way that is not quite as helpful as a knowing a target audience. The goal of this Elm guide is to target JavaScript developers, so knowledge of JavaScript will be assumed and talked about. If you new to programming and feel up to Elm (which is awesome!) I recommend searching Richard Feldman's talks on Elm. They are a little outdated due to a version update recently to Elm, but they are excellent for getting your head wrapped around the ideas that drive Elm. At the same time read through: http://guide.elm-lang.org/

This training (the writen part) is not complete quite yet, but there is already tons covered so get you going.

## Assumptions

Some assumptions I am making about the reader is:

1. You can use your terminal for your particular OS
2. You have some programing experience and understand the basics well
3. You are open minded about functional programming

## Understating the Directory Structure

### Tutorial

The tutorial folder is the place where we work through learning Elm and implementing our project

### JS-Example

The `js-example` folder is the folder where I quickly through together an example final project. Mostly to give me clarity on direction on helping JavaScript developers understand Elm.
